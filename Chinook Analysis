#Here are questions that I used to analyze a database called Chinook.
#This database represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. 

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US:
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "USA";

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil:
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country:
SELECT I.InvoiceId, I.InvoiceDate, I.BillingCountry, C.FirstName, C.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices AS I
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS C
ON C.CustomerId=I.CustomerId
WHERE I.BillingCountry= "Brazil";

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents:
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table:
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.Invoices;

#6. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#7. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';
